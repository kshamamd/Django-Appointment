Admin is responsible for approving the appointment booked by the person. This must be done from his/her login account. Once approved, a booked appointment status should be changed
to approved for the respective person in his/her login account.

A new user have to register first and then login. After login user can make appointment with the form provided as "make appointment" 
In the admin panel superuser is created and a new module for saving appointments named as "news" is there.
Status attribute is added to the appointment form admin will make changes to that as approved or pending.

The unimplemented portion is after submitting the appointment form constraint error is there instead of request send msg.
and some issue with css
